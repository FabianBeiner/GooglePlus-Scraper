# GooglePlus-Scraper
v1.0.2

**This class can be used to retrieve data from a Google+ profile with PHP. It is rather a proof of concept than something for productive use.**

The technique used is called “web scraping” (see [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_scraping "Web scraping") for details). That means: If Google+ changes anything on their HTML, the script is going to fail.

* Better regular expressions
* …
